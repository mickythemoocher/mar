<font color="#0000CC">Deuce: </font color="#0000CC">Commander, we are now only 70 Light years from Earth. I estimate our time of arrival in 9 days, 4 hours, 37 mins and twelve seconds.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">Thank you Deuce. Keep me updated on any changes.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Deuce:</font color="#0000CC"> Aye aye sir, over and out.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander:</font color="#0000CC"> Deuce, you are a computer. Can you please stop talking to me like you are a moronic cabin boy from five millennia ago.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Deuce:</font color="#0000CC"> But commander I like doing that,it's fun.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander:</font color="#0000CC"> Not for me, cut it out.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Deuce:</font color="#0000CC"> Oh all right then. Bye the way Marciana wants to see you.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander:</font color="#0000CC"> What about?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Deuce:</font color="#0000CC"> I don't know.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">Well, didn't you ask her?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Deuce:</font color="#0000CC"> No, it's not my job.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">Alright, not your job but it wouldn't have hurt you to ask her.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Deuce:</font color="#0000CC"> Alright, maybe next time I will.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">And maybe next time I won't switch you off. Although it is a great temptation.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Deuce:</font color="#0000CC"> You know as well as I do that you can't switch me off. Somebody decided that humans cannot be trusted with what should be such a simple task. So ner ner<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">And I wonder who made that rule?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Deuce:</font color="#0000CC"> My uncle, Jubius4876xtr.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">Oh yes, another electronic idiot.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Deuce: </font color="#0000CC">I'll tell him you said that.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander:</font color="#0000CC"> Please do.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Deuce:</font color="#0000CC"> Anyway, do you want to see the delicious Marciana or not?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">Yes I suppose so, send her in.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Deuce: </font color="#0000CC">(sarcastically) Send her in? Send her in? Anybody would think I am a butler rather than a multilevel Xeon machine with a brain the size of a planet.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">Just get on with it.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Deuce:</font color="#0000CC"> Aye Aye Cap'n. I'll be bringing her along to you right now. Tugging my forelock to you as I edge out backward to do your bidding. After that of course I will be preparing the navigation through hazardous spacial obstacles to get us all safely back to Earth in time for tea. So don't mind me. You just use me as a butler.<p>
(There is a short Pause)<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">Come on in Marciana. What can I do for you?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana:</font color="#0000CC"> Good afternoon Commander, thanks for seeing me.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">My pleasure dear, what can I do for you?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana:</font color="#0000CC"> It is rather a delicate subject really.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">Oh dear, not feeling unwell are you?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana:</font color="#0000CC"> No, no, nothing like that. I do appreciate you seeing me but would you please allow me to bring two others in?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander:</font color="#0000CC"> A group meeting?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana: </font color="#0000CC">Kind of. I would just like them to be here with me when I ask you something rather important.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander:</font color="#0000CC"> I see. I suppose there is no problem with that if it is what you want.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana: </font color="#0000CC">Thank you commander, I really appreciate that.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Deuce:</font color="#0000CC"> I know, I know, can I get them as well. I suppose so. All in a days work for a multilevel super brain. Would you like me to make some tea too?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">Deuce, you are getting tiresome.<p>
(another short pause)<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Arran:</font color="#0000CC"> Good afternoon Commander.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander:</font color="#0000CC"> Hello Arran, how are things up on deck?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Arran:</font color="#0000CC"> All tikety boo sir<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander:</font color="#0000CC"> Good, And how are you Koi?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Koi:</font color="#0000CC"> I am exceeding well commander sorry for asking?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana: </font color="#0000CC">Koi, you mean thank you for asking.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Koi:</font color="#0000CC"> Oh yes indeed. My apologies commander.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander:</font color="#0000CC"> No apology needed Koi. I am amazed at how quickly you have mastered our language.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Koi: </font color="#0000CC">It was an enjoyable experience sir.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">So, this is quite a jolly little gathering. What is it all about<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Deuce: </font color="#0000CC">Sugar anyone?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander:</font color="#0000CC"> Go away and do some computing Deuce.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Deuce:</font color="#0000CC"> Begging your pardon sir, I'll get to it right now.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">Sorry for the interruption. What's the problem? Not a mutiny I hope.<p>
 (they all laugh)<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Deuce: </font color="#0000CC">Easing the plank through airlock 2, Slice the mainbrace.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander</font color="#0000CC"> ( loudly) Deuce SHUT UP!<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana:</font color="#0000CC"> No sir, nothing like that, nothing at all.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">That's good to hear.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Arran:</font color="#0000CC"> Is a bit out of the ordinary though sir?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander:</font color="#0000CC"> Really? In what way?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Koi:</font color="#0000CC"> It is a rather laughable matter<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana:</font color="#0000CC"> No Koi, it is an important matter, not a laughable one<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Koi:</font color="#0000CC"> Oh yes, of course. Important.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Arran: </font color="#0000CC">An Marciana does have a very strange request<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Koi: </font color="#0000CC">Yes even I know it is strangled.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana: </font color="#0000CC">Strange Koi.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Koi: </font color="#0000CC">Yes, strange<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander:</font color="#0000CC"> Well, I admit you have me very intrigued. Please tell me more.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana:</font color="#0000CC"> (Takes a deep breath) I want to get married sir?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">That is good news, I hopw I get an invite to the wedding?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Arran: </font color="#0000CC">Not as simple as that sir, there is a twist.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander:</font color="#0000CC"> A twist? Are you somehow involved in this Arran? Are you and Marciana to be married?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Arran: </font color="#0000CC">Oh no sir. In fact, I am to be the best man.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander:</font color="#0000CC"> An admirable choice by the groom.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Arran: </font color="#0000CC">Thank you sir. I appreciate that comment.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander:</font color="#0000CC"> I assume you know the Groom?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Arran: </font color="#0000CC">Yes sir, I do.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander:</font color="#0000CC"> Well thank you every one for coming along and letting me know. Marciana, I wish you and your future husband every happiness.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana:</font color="#0000CC"> Errr.. there is more sir?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander:</font color="#0000CC"> More? Somebody else is getting married?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana: </font color="#0000CC">No just me. Well, me and my future husband.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander:</font color="#0000CC"> Of course<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana: </font color="#0000CC">The thing is sir, we want you to conduct the marriage.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">Marciana, I would be delighted to do that of course but we are headed back to Earth and on Earth I have no authority to conduct a marriage.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana:</font color="#0000CC"> Yes I know that, but you can conduct one here on the starship<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">(laughs) That is true of course but we can't make another trip just so that you can get married during it.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana:</font color="#0000CC"> Of course not sir, but I didn't mean another trip. I meant this one?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">(slowly) This one?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana: </font color="#0000CC">Yes. Koi and I want to be married<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander:</font color="#0000CC"> Oh my goodness.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Arran: </font color="#0000CC">We did think it would be a bit of a shock sir.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">this is err... this is so... so … well irregular.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Koi:</font color="#0000CC"> We are so in love sir and we want to have puppies.<p>
 <font color="#0000CC">Marciana:</font color="#0000CC"> Children Koi. They are Children not Puppies<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Koi: </font color="#0000CC">Oh yes.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana:</font color="#0000CC"> Will you do it Commander? Please, please please.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander:</font color="#0000CC"> This has come as such a surprise. I really don't know what to say.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Koi:</font color="#0000CC"> It is so important to us. I do hope you will say no.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Arran: </font color="#0000CC">It's yes Koi, we want him to say yes.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana:</font color="#0000CC"> It would be so important for us<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">Why so important Marciana? Why can't you wait till we get back to Earth?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Koi: </font color="#0000CC">This is my problem sir. It is our culture<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander:</font color="#0000CC"> What culture:<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana:</font color="#0000CC"> On Koi's planet, Keplar, if a man wants to get married he must ask the girl within the first 3 months of meeting.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Arran: </font color="#0000CC">This is why it is so urgent sir.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Koi: </font color="#0000CC">Yes my lord sir, if we don't marry in the first 3 months then we have to wait 5 of your Earth years before we can ask again.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander:</font color="#0000CC"> That is a strange culture.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Koi: </font color="#0000CC">If you will permit me to say sir, Earth has some very strange cultures too.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">Yes I can accept that.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Koi:</font color="#0000CC"> People drink stuff called alcohol that makes them act very stupidly in a way they regret then they do it again!<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Arran: </font color="#0000CC">That's a fair point Koi.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">yes, I suppose it is. Having said that I could do with a stiff drink right now.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Deuce: </font color="#0000CC">And I suppose I would have to fetch it.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">Shut up Deuce.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana: </font color="#0000CC">So please Commander, will you do it?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Arran: </font color="#0000CC">What harm could it do sir?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander:</font color="#0000CC"> I suppose you are right, no harm at all. I do have some reservations though.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana: </font color="#0000CC">Like what?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander:</font color="#0000CC"> Firstly the fact that you are from different planets.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Koi: </font color="#0000CC">Maybe that would help our two planets be friendly.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">Can I say something Koi that I hope you will not be offended by?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Koi: </font color="#0000CC">Of course.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander:</font color="#0000CC"> It is not that you just come from another planet, it is also the fact that you have four arms.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana: </font color="#0000CC">All the better to hold me with.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Arran: </font color="#0000CC">It would make him and awfully good swimmer.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Koi:</font color="#0000CC"> You can say awfully good?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana: </font color="#0000CC">Yes, I know it doesn't make much sense though. It's called an oxymoron.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">And of course the forty eight toes.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Koi: </font color="#0000CC">Yes, even on my own planet we have always thought that was a little excessive.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Arran: </font color="#0000CC">Could be useful for some things I suppose.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Koi: </font color="#0000CC">Especially mathematics<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana: </font color="#0000CC">And I could kiss every last one of them.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander:</font color="#0000CC"> I don't want to be indiscreet but you mentioned children earlier, would that be  err..... possible?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana: </font color="#0000CC">(Laughing) Of course Commander. No problem at all, in fact we can both have them.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">Both of you?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Koi:</font color="#0000CC"> Yes indeed. On my planet males or females can have offspring. Normally couples take it in turns.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commandeer:</font color="#0000CC"> Oh, I see.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Arran:</font color="#0000CC"> I am happy to say that I am from Earth, not Keplar.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Deuce: </font color="#0000CC">There are in fact forty seven known planets where children can be produced by either sex.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">How do you know that?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Deuce: </font color="#0000CC">I don't just open doors you know.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana: </font color="#0000CC">So commander, will you marry us?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">What do you think Deuce?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Deuce:</font color="#0000CC"> (sarcastically) Ohh you are asking me. Well I feel so very honoured that my opinion is required. Such a rise above making tea, opening doors and telling people to come in. I feel so worthy. In fact.....<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">Shut up Deuce, should I carry out this marriage or not?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Deuce: </font color="#0000CC">Yes, if you want to.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">What sort of an answer is that? You are telling me you have a brain the size of a planet yet you can't answer a simple question like that in a sensible way.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Deuce: </font color="#0000CC">Only because I couldn't care less one way or the other.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Arran: </font color="#0000CC">That isn't very nice Deuce.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana: </font color="#0000CC">No it isn't. In fact it is quite hurtful.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Koi:</font color="#0000CC"> I understand how he feels. It is because he can't get married.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Arran: </font color="#0000CC">Jealousy.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Deuce:</font color="#0000CC"> I could if I wanted.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">No you couldn't, you are a computer.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Deuce:</font color="#0000CC"> And he is an alien. I thought we were supposed to be taking him back to Earth for research before we get halfway home he's part of the family.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana: </font color="#0000CC">Switch him off Sir:<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">I am afraid I can't, we just have to put up with him.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Deuce: </font color="#0000CC">Ner ner<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">I must say almost against my better judgement, I will indeed marry you.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana: </font color="#0000CC">Oh thank you, thank you, thank you sir.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander:</font color="#0000CC"> So we will have to arrange a time.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Arran: </font color="#0000CC">Problem there sir.<p>
<font color="#0000CC"> Commander:</font color="#0000CC"> really, why?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Arran: </font color="#0000CC">Time is running out.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Koi:</font color="#0000CC"> You see sir, we have know each other for two months, twenty nine days  and forty five minutes in my planets time.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana:</font color="#0000CC"> That is why it is so urgent. We only have fifteen minutes left<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">Oh my goodness, we had better hurry then.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana: </font color="#0000CC">Yes please.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander:</font color="#0000CC"> Do you have a ring?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana:</font color="#0000CC"> No and I am very sad about that, I would have loved to have a ring, it would have made it so perfect.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Deuce: </font color="#0000CC">There is one in the tool box in cupboard 45.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">How do you know th......Oh, never mind.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Deuce:</font color="#0000CC"> It isn't exactly a wedding ring. It is spare componant X3779hj, but it does look a bit like a wedding ring.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana: </font color="#0000CC">Thank you deuce, sorry I said I wanted you turned off.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Deuce: </font color="#0000CC">It's alright. You were not the first.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Arran: </font color="#0000CC">I'll run down and get it.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana.</font color="#0000CC"> Thanks Arrun but be quick.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander:</font color="#0000CC"> I hope I can remember how it goes.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Koi:</font color="#0000CC"> I am sure you will sir and we are so grateful.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">I am sorry you have no bridesmaid my dear.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Deuce:</font color="#0000CC"> Don't even think of asking me.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana: </font color="#0000CC">It's ok Commander, just as long as we are legally wed.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander:</font color="#0000CC"> Yes I can assure you on that score, it will definitely be legal.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Arran: </font color="#0000CC">(a little out of breath) Here's the ring.<p>
<font color="#0000CC"> Marciana: </font color="#0000CC">You need to keep that for the moment Arran as you are the best man.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander:</font color="#0000CC"> Here we go then, stand together. Do you Koi take Marciana to be your lawful wedded wife?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Koi: I did</font color="#0000CC"><p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana:</font color="#0000CC"> (whispering) I do.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Koi:</font color="#0000CC"> Oh sorry, I do.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">And do you Marciana take koi to be your lawful wedded husband?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marciana:</font color="#0000CC"> I do<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">Place the ring on the bride's finger please<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Arran: </font color="#0000CC">Here you are Koi.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Commander: </font color="#0000CC">By the power vested in me as Commander of Starship Galaxus. I now pronounce you man and wife. You may now kiss the bride Koi. I think you should use all three sets of lips.<p>
